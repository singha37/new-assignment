                                 <h5>   Tauranga Hospital provides health services to the people of the Western Bay of Plenty. A secondary hospital, it provides level 4-5 services including medical, surgical, paediatrics, obstetrics, gynaecology and mental health. The hospital is also a base for a range of associated clinical support services and allied health, such as rehabilitation, speech therapy, physiotherapy, stroke and cardiac support, district nursing and drug and alcohol programmes.
                                        
                                        There are 349 beds at Tauranga Hospital, including the Special Care Baby Unit, maternity and mental health. Approximately 224 beds are available for medical and surgical patients (including critical care and coronary care) with a further 58 for children and older people and 17 for medical day stay.

                                        Tauranga Hospital serves one of the fastest growing populations in the country and the campus has undergone significant development in recent years to allow the BOPDHB to grow health services to match. In recent years the hospital has seen the construction of a new wing, including new theatres, outpatients department and maternity unit, of extremely high quality.
                                        
                                        In 2007, the Bay of Plenty Clinical School was set up to provide our health workforce with clinical training, facilities, resources and support for clinical trials and research projects.</h5>
